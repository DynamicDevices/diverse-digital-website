## Executive Summary

Dionne has created comprehensive planning documents that show a clear vision for rebranding and relaunching Diverse Digital. The documents are well-structured and align with many of our website review recommendations. However, there are some critical gaps between the current website state and these plans, particularly around the SEO issues we identified.

**Key Finding:** The planning documents assume a "relaunch" but the current website has critical SEO issues (title tag says "Faith Groups") that need immediate fixing regardless of relaunch timeline.

## Document 1: 90-Day Relaunch Plan

### Overview
A structured 3-phase plan (Foundation, Growth, Conversion) spanning 90 days with weekly deliverables.

### Strengths ✅
- **Clear timeline and phases** - Well-organized with specific weekly goals
- **Realistic targets** - 6-12 discovery calls, 3-6 retainer clients by day 90
- **Comprehensive approach** - Covers brand, website, social, networking, partnerships
- **Actionable deliverables** - Each week has specific outputs

### Alignment with Our Review ✅
- **Week 2: Website & Portfolio** - Aligns with our recommendation for case studies/testimonials
- **Week 3: Social Media Relaunch** - Addresses content marketing gap we identified
- **Week 5: Thought Leadership** - Supports our blog/content recommendations
- **Week 6: Workshops** - Creates lead generation opportunities
- **Week 9: Showcase Client Work** - Directly addresses missing social proof

### Critical Gaps ⚠️

1. **No Immediate SEO Fixes** ❌
   - Plan doesn't address the critical title tag/meta description issues
   - These should be fixed BEFORE relaunch (takes 10 minutes)
   - Current SEO score of 8/100 will hurt relaunch visibility

2. **Website Build Timeline** ⚠️
   - Week 2 assumes website build/refine
   - Our review shows current site needs immediate fixes
   - Should prioritize fixing existing site before building new

3. **Missing Technical SEO** ⚠️
   - No mention of Google Search Console setup
   - No sitemap creation
   - No structured data implementation
   - These are critical for relaunch success

### Recommendations

**Add to Week 1 (Before Brand Finalisation):**
- Fix title tag and meta description (10 minutes)
- Set up Google Search Console
- Verify all page titles are correct

**Enhance Week 2:**
- Include technical SEO audit
- Add structured data implementation
- Create and submit XML sitemap
