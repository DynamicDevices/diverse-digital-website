Based on your skills, lived experience, credibility, and existing
assets, there are three business directions that would position you
strongly and attract an audience that values your expertise. I’ll
outline them clearly so you can choose the direction that feels most
aligned.

✅ Your Ideal Business Direction

→ A Digital Communications & Visibility Agency for Under-represented
Entrepreneurs, Social Impact Organisations, and Small Businesses

This aligns perfectly with:

-   Your digital marketing skillset

-   Your business coaching qualification

-   Your experience founding Deaf Business Academy

-   Your reputation for advocacy, inclusion, and empowerment

-   Your goal of moving away from faith communities into a more engaged
    market

This market needs support, has growing demand, and resonates with your
values.

🎯 Your Most Profitable Target Audiences

Here are the audiences who would BOTH value you and pay for long-term
digital support:

1. Under-represented Entrepreneurs (Black, Disabled, Women of Colour,
Deaf)

These groups often struggle with visibility, digital strategy, and
accessing accessible or culturally competent support.

Why they’re ideal:

-   They value inclusive support

-   They already follow you for activism/advocacy

-   They need branding, content, digital skills, and coaching

-   You have lived experience credibility

Services they would pay for:

-   Done-for-you social media and email marketing

-   Website and content support

-   Launch support for courses, books, or products

-   Digital skills coaching

2. Small Purpose-Driven Organisations (Social Enterprises, Community
Interest Companies, Grassroots Organisations)

These organisations often lack resources and digital expertise.

Why they’re ideal:

-   They struggle with marketing consistency

-   They usually have some budget for digital comms

-   They want measurable impact and steady support

-   They respond better than faith groups

Services they want:

-   Social media management

-   Newsletter creation

-   Digital strategy

-   Branding and content creation

-   Volunteer/staff digital training

3. Accessibility-Focused Businesses or Organisations

Because of your Deaf Business Academy background, you are uniquely
positioned to support:

-   Deaf-led businesses

-   Disability-led organisations

-   Accessibility-conscious brands

-   Businesses that want to improve inclusive communication

Why they’re ideal:

-   This is a specialist niche with very little competition

-   You have lived experience + professional credibility

-   Businesses are increasingly required to demonstrate accessibility

Services you could provide:

-   Accessible digital communications audits

-   BSL accessible content strategies

-   Training for organisations on inclusive digital communication

-   Consulting for accessible branding and marketing

-   Workshops

⭐ Where All Three Audiences Overlap

They need someone who can help them:

-   Build online visibility

-   Create content they don’t have time or skills to create

-   Understand social media and digital strategy

-   Grow their audiences

-   Communicate more inclusively

This overlap = the sweet spot for Diverse Digital’s new direction.

🚀 Which Business Model Should You Build?

A hybrid of agency + coaching + training gives you the strongest
long-term success.

9. Social Media Post Examples

Post Example #1 — Visibility

Your message is powerful — but only if people see it.
Diverse Digital helps under-represented entrepreneurs and small
organisations show up consistently with social media, content, and email
support that actually connects.

Post Example #2 — Accessibility

Accessibility isn’t optional.
If your content isn’t clear, inclusive, and easy to understand, you’re
leaving people behind.
We help you create digital communications that everyone can access and
engage with.

Post Example #3 — Coaching

Digital confidence doesn’t happen overnight — but it does happen with
the right support.
Our 1:1 coaching sessions give you clarity, direction, and a content
plan that feels achievable, not overwhelming.

Post Example #4 — Community Focus

Small organisations change lives — but many don’t have the digital
capacity to tell their story.
Diverse Digital fills that gap with hands-on support, creative content,
and communication strategies tailored to your mission.

🚀✨ LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT: Introducing the New Diverse Digital

I’m excited to share that Diverse Digital has officially relaunched with
a brand-new direction, new services, and a renewed commitment to
supporting the communities that need it most.

After careful reflection — and recognising the gap in digital support
for under-represented entrepreneurs, small purpose-driven organisations,
and accessibility-focused businesses — Diverse Digital is stepping
forward with a clearer, stronger mission:

👉🏾 To help diverse voices, mission-led businesses, and small teams build
confident, inclusive, and impactful digital communications.

No jargon. No overwhelm. No impossible expectations.
Just honest, accessible support that meets you where you are.

💡 What’s New?

✨ Digital Marketing & Visibility Services

Social media management, newsletters, content creation, CRM/email
support, website content, and more.

✨ Digital Coaching

1:1 sessions for entrepreneurs and small teams who want clarity,
direction, and digital confidence.

✨ Accessible & Inclusive Communication Support

Audits, workshops, and consulting designed to help businesses
communicate clearly with diverse communities — grounded in my experience
founding Deaf Business Academy.

✨ Full-Service Digital Communications Support

For organisations that need consistent, reliable, and long-term digital
help.

🌍 Who We Support

Diverse Digital is now fully focused on:

-   Under-represented entrepreneurs

-   Black, Deaf, disabled, migrant, and women-led businesses

-   Social enterprises & CICs

-   Community organisations

-   Accessibility-conscious brands

-   Small teams with big missions

These are the communities I’m passionate about amplifying — and where
Diverse Digital can make the greatest impact.

🤝 Why the Change?

Because many organisations and entrepreneurs doing important,
life-changing work simply don’t get the digital support they deserve.

Because representation and accessibility matter.

And because digital visibility shouldn’t be a privilege — it should be
possible for everyone.

✨ Let’s Work Together

If your organisation needs help showing up online, building digital
confidence, or communicating with clarity and impact, I’d love to
support you.
