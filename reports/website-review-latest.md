| **Best Practices** | 87/100 | 59/100 | ⬆️ +28 points | ✅ **Improved** |
| **SEO** | 2/100 | 80/100 | ⬇️ -78 points | ⚠️ **Concerning** |

### Analysis

#### Performance (100/100) ✅
- **Status:** Excellent
- **Load Time:** 1.69 seconds (slower than previous 0.09s, likely network conditions)
- **Page Size:** 242 KB (slightly smaller than previous 257 KB)
- **Assessment:** Performance remains excellent

#### Accessibility (100/100) ✅
- **Status:** Perfect
- **Assessment:** Maintained perfect accessibility score - important for business positioning

#### Best Practices (87/100) ✅ **IMPROVED**
- **Previous:** 59/100
- **Current:** 87/100
- **Change:** +28 points improvement
- **Assessment:** Significant improvement! Likely fixed issues that caused the previous drop

#### SEO (2/100) ⚠️ **CONCERNING**
- **Previous:** 80/100
- **Current:** 2/100
- **Change:** -78 points (major drop)
- **Assessment:** This is very concerning and unexpected given that title tag and meta description are now correct

**Root Cause Identified:**
The SEO score dropped due to a **critical link text issue**:
- ❌ **FAIL:** "Links do not have descriptive text" (Weight: 1.0)
- This means there are links on the page without descriptive anchor text (e.g., "click here", "read more", or empty links)
- This is a significant SEO issue that needs immediate fixing

**Other SEO Elements Status:**
- ✅ Page isn't blocked from indexing: PASS
- ✅ Document has a `<title>` element: PASS
- ✅ Document has a meta description: PASS
- ✅ Page has successful HTTP status code: PASS
- ✅ Links are crawlable: PASS
- ✅ robots.txt is valid: PASS
- ✅ Image elements have `[alt]` attributes: PASS
- ✅ Document has a valid `hreflang`: PASS
- ℹ️ Document has a valid `rel=canonical`: N/A (not present, but not required)
- ℹ️ Structured data is valid: N/A (not present, but not required)

**Action Required:** Fix non-descriptive link text immediately - this is causing the SEO score drop
