## Critical Issues Status

### ❌ STILL UNFIXED: Title Tag

**Current State:**
```html
<title>Digital Services for Faith Groups - Affordable Solutions</title>
```

**Should Be:**
```html
<title>Diverse Digital | Digital Marketing for Purpose-Driven Businesses</title>
```

**Status:** ❌ **STILL WRONG** - This is the most critical SEO issue and remains unfixed.

**Impact:**
- Search engines still indexing site incorrectly
- People searching for actual services won't find the site
- Brand confusion continues

---

### ❌ STILL UNFIXED: Meta Description

**Current State:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Affordable digital services for faith groups, supporting community action with tailored digital solutions for churches."/>
```

**Should Be:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Empowering diverse and purpose-driven businesses with accessible digital marketing, social media management, and accessibility consulting. Book your discovery call today."/>
```

**Status:** ❌ **STILL WRONG** - Critical SEO element remains incorrect.

**Impact:**
- Poor search result descriptions
- Users won't understand what business actually does
- Low click-through rates from search

---

### ✅ IMPROVED: Social Media Tags

**Open Graph Tags (for Facebook/LinkedIn):**
```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Diverse Digital"/>
<meta property="og:description" content="To be seen, heard, and supported online."/>
```

**Twitter Tags:**
```html
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Diverse Digital"/>
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Empowering Diverse and Purpose-driven Businesses"/>
```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - Social media tags have been updated properly.

**Impact:**
- Good social media sharing appearance
- However, this doesn't help with search engine SEO (Google doesn't use these for ranking)

## SEO Score Improvement Analysis

### What Improved (8/100 → 80/100)

The SEO score improved dramatically, which suggests some technical SEO improvements were made. Possible changes:

1. **Structured Data** - May have been added
2. **Internal Linking** - May have been improved
3. **Heading Structure** - May have been fixed
4. **Alt Text** - May have been added to images
5. **URL Structure** - May have been optimized
6. **Canonical Tags** - May have been added/fixed

**However:** The title tag and meta description are still wrong, which is why the score isn't 90-100.

---

## Best Practices Score Drop (90 → 59)

### ⚠️ Concerning Change

The Best Practices score dropped from 90/100 to 59/100. This could indicate:

1. **New Third-Party Scripts** - May have added tracking or other scripts
2. **Security Issues** - May have introduced vulnerabilities
3. **Performance Issues** - May have added heavy resources
4. **Accessibility Regression** - Unlikely given accessibility score unchanged
5. **Console Errors** - May have introduced JavaScript errors

**Action Required:** Investigate what caused this drop. Check:
- Browser console for errors
- New third-party scripts
- Security headers
- Performance optimizations

---

## What Hasn't Changed

### Still Missing (As Identified in Initial Review)

1. **Client Testimonials** - Still not visible on homepage
2. **Case Studies/Portfolio** - Still missing
3. **Blog Section** - Still not present
4. **Resource Library** - Still missing
5. **Enhanced About Page** - Still basic

These align with the 90-day relaunch plan timeline, so may be in progress.
